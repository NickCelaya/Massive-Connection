# mini-sql-node-massive

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the pre-requisites

Look over the index.js file to get familiar with your starting point.

## Get your database started

Make sure postgres is running on your computer.

## Install MassiveJS

Run `npm install --save massive@3.0.0-rc1`

We are installing this specific version of massive because it introduces a lot of breaking changes, and we want to teach you the new API for Massive.

Require massive at the top of your index file.

`var massive = require('massive');`

## Setup our table

Make a new database in postgres called sandbox

Add a new table to that database ( [pgAdmin tutorial on how to do both of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvDVBjNDys) ) :

```
CREATE TABLE airplanes (
  planeid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, -- The primary key
  planetype varchar(40) NOT NULL, -- The IP of the host
  passengercount integer NOT NULL -- The name of the host
);
```


## Connect with Massive to our database

We need to get a copy of massive ot use.  We need : `connectionString > connection > db`

Add a connection string under your call to require massive.  Change the part that says jeremyrobertson to have your user name.  (If you included password it will look like `username:password@localhost/sandbox`

__connectionString__
```
var massive = require('massive');
var connectionString = "postgres://jeremyrobertson@localhost/sandbox";
```

Use our connection string to get a copy/instance of massive to use.  Then add it to our app as a variable called db.

__connection__
```
var app = express();
massive(connectionString).then(dbInstance => app.set('db', dbInstance))
```

Express will help you retrieve the dbInstance in each of your routes, like so:

```
app.get('/api/stuff', function(req, res) {
    var dbInstance = req.app.get('db');

    dbInstance.get_stuff().then(stuff => {
        res.status(200).json(stuff);
    })
})
```

## Add a new plane to the database

We can add some seed data to our database in the promise callback after massive:

```
var app = express()
massive(connectionString).then(function(dbInstance) {
    app.set('db', dbInstance);

    dbInstance.new_plane(function(err, planes) {
        console.log(err, "planes added");
    })
})
```

This works by looking in the `/db` folder in our app for a file called `new_plane.sql`

We've added some planes, so comment out those 3 lines of code so we don't add duplicates.


## Get all planes

Do the same thing to get all planes using the get_planes file

```
db.get_planes(function(err, planes){
    console.log(err, planes)
})
```

Remember this has to be done in the callback from the massive connection

## Queries in different files

We can use our db anywhere req is made available to us. We can use it in a controller like so:

__index.js__


```
var massive = require('massive');
var controller = require('./controller')
var connectionString = 'postgres://Brett@localhost/sandbox'

var app = express()
massive(connectionString).then(dbInstance => {
    app.set('db', dbInstance)
})

app.get('/api/planes', controller.getPlanes);

```

__controller.js__
```
exports.getPlanes = function(req, res) {
  var dbInstance = req.app.get('db')

  dbInstance.get_planes().then(planes => {
      res.status(200).json(planes)
  })
})
```


## Parameterize our Query

In get_planes.sql add `where passengercount > $1`.

The $1 acts as a place holder for the 'first' parameter passed in.

To pass that in change the query in controller.js to take parameters before the function.

```
exports.getPlanes = function(req, res) {
  var dbInstance = req.app.get('db')

  dbInstance.get_planes([25]).then(planes => {
      res.status(200).json(planes)
  })
}
```        

We are now getting all planes with a passenger count greater than 25.
